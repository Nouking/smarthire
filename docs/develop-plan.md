## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Strategy

### Technology Stack Rationale

**Next.js 14 with App Router Decision:**
- **Strategic Advantage**: Server Actions provide CSRF-protected APIs without separate backend
- **Performance Benefit**: Built-in optimization for mobile Core Web Vitals
- **Cost Efficiency**: Serverless deployment reduces operational overhead
- **Developer Velocity**: Type-safe client-server communication accelerates development

**Supabase Platform Selection:**
- **Financial Strategy**: Free tier supports 500MB database + 50K auth users
- **Technical Capability**: PostgreSQL + pgvector enables AI-powered semantic search
- **Scalability Path**: Clear upgrade path as user base grows
- **Feature Completeness**: Authentication, database, storage, and real-time in one platform

**Mobile-First Architecture Approach:**
- **Market Alignment**: Target users (hiring managers) primarily use mobile/tablet devices
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Current competitors are desktop-first
- **Technical Foundation**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for native-like experience
- **Performance Focus**: Mobile-optimized for 3-second page load requirement

### Agent Role Distribution Strategy

**Strategic Agent Assignments:**
- **@architect (Winston)**: System design decisions requiring cross-stack expertise
- **@dev (James)**: Primary implementation with full-stack development capability
- **@po (Sarah)**: Quality assurance ensuring alignment with business requirements
- **@ux-expert (Sally)**: Mobile-first design system consultation
- **@sm (Bob)**: Sprint coordination and task breakdown management

**Collaboration Patterns:**
- **Architecture Decisions**: @architect + @dev collaboration on technical choices
- **Implementation Quality**: @po validation of all deliverables against acceptance criteria
- **User Experience**: @ux-expert consultation on mobile-first design decisions
- **Project Coordination**: @sm oversight of sprint progress and dependency management
