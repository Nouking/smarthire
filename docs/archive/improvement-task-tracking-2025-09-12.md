# SmartHire AI Improvement Task Tracking

> Policy: This tracker keeps full details only for Pending/In Progress tasks. Completed tasks are summarized here and linked to their full write-ups in `docs/completed-tasks.md` to prevent file bloat.

> **Agent-Ready Implementation Plan** - Structured for @architect, @dev, @po, @ux-expert, @sm workflow integration

This document tracks Epic 14: Phase 1 Foundation (Sprint 1.1) based on the SmartHire AI implementation plan. All tasks are mapped to specific, actionable implementations that AI agents can execute following the established project workflow.

## üìã Task Status Legend

- **Pending**: Not yet started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Finished successfully
- **In Review**: Ready for testing and review
- **Blocked**: Unable to proceed due to external factors
- **Error**: Task failed with issues that need resolution

## üéØ Agent Workflow Integration

### Git Branch Naming Convention

- **Format**: `dev-{epic-id}-{task-id}-{kebab-case-description}`
- **Example**: `dev-e14-t1-nextjs-foundation-setup`

### Agent Responsibilities & Capabilities

**Core Project Management:**

- **@sm (Bob)**: Sprint planning, epic breakdown, developer handoff preparation, agile facilitation
- **@po (Sarah)**: Task validation, quality assurance, acceptance criteria verification, process adherence
- **@architect (Winston)**: System design, technology selection, architecture documentation, technical strategy

**Technical Implementation:**

- **@dev (James)**: Code implementation, debugging, refactoring, development execution
- **@ux-expert (Sally)**: UI/UX design, mobile-first responsive design, user experience optimization

**Multi-Role Collaboration:**
Tasks are assigned primary agents with supporting agents based on expertise overlap. Complex tasks leverage 2-3 agents working together for comprehensive coverage.
