- Status: Completed - 2025-08-18 | Branch: `improvement-e13-t3-api-fetch-error-fix`
- Summary: Resolved "Failed to fetch" errors in /v2/view by implementing centralized API client with retry logic, comprehensive error boundaries, and enhanced authentication validation
- Implementation Details:
  - **Files Created/Modified**:
    - `family-tree/app/lib/apiClient.ts` - New centralized API client with timeout, retry logic, and typed error handling
    - `family-tree/app/lib/errorBoundary.tsx` - React error boundary component with graceful fallback UI
    - `family-tree/app/v2/view/page.tsx` - Added error boundary wrapper and server-side error handling
    - `family-tree/app/components-v2/AddMemberModalV2.tsx` - Updated to use new API client with enhanced error messages
    - `family-tree/next.config.ts` - Added CORS headers for API routes
  - **Key Features**:
    - Centralized API client with automatic retry logic (configurable timeout and retry attempts)
    - Comprehensive error classification (401 auth, 400 validation, 408 timeout, 5xx server errors)
    - React Error Boundary with user-friendly fallback UI and recovery options
    - CORS configuration for development and production environments
    - Enhanced error message extraction supporting both `message` and `error` response fields
  - **Technical Achievements**:
    - Fixed root cause: API response error field mismatch (`error` vs `message`)
    - Implemented progressive error handling: retry â†’ user feedback â†’ graceful degradation
    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging future API issues
    - TypeScript-safe API client with proper generic typing
- Verification Notes:
  - Build succeeded with no TypeScript errors
  - Error boundary provides meaningful feedback for different error scenarios
  - API client handles network failures, timeouts, and authentication issues gracefully
  - All interactive features (add member, search, view) function without "Failed to fetch" errors
