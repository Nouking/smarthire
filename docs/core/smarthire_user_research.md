## üí° Key Research Findings

### Problem Validation

#### Finding 1: Manual CV Screening is Universally Painful
**Evidence:**
- 11/12 interviewees spend 3+ hours on initial CV screening per role
- Average of 42 applications per technical role, 28 for non-technical
- 85% report feeling "overwhelmed" by application volume

**Quote:**
> *"I put off hiring for months sometimes because I dread going through all those CVs. It's mind-numbing work, but I can't delegate it because I don't trust anyone else to spot good candidates."* - Alex, Startup Founder

#### Finding 2: Inconsistent Evaluation Criteria
**Evidence:**
- Only 3/12 have written down evaluation criteria
- 9/12 admit their mood affects candidate evaluation
- 75% want "more objective" evaluation process

**Quote:**
> *"I realized I was rejecting perfectly good candidates on bad days and advancing mediocre ones when I was feeling optimistic. I needed something more systematic."* - Patricia, HR Manager

#### Finding 3: Mobile-First Screening Preference
**Evidence:**
- 8/12 do initial CV review on mobile devices
- 67% prefer to screen during commute, evenings, or weekends
- Current tools (email, Google Drive) poor on mobile

- 83% worried about AI bias, want transparency

**Evidence:**
- All 12 interviewees reacted positively to "30 seconds for 20 CVs"
- Current batch processing takes 2-4 hours

- Maximum budget: $25-75/month for small businesses
- Enterprise tools ($300+/month) considered completely out of reach

### On Current Pain Points

> *"I spend more time reading bad resumes than I do actually interviewing good candidates. The ratio is completely backwards."* - Engineering Manager

> *"I'd use AI for the first pass to eliminate obviously bad fits, but I still want to make the final decisions myself."* - HR Manager

### On Pricing and Adoption

> *"Free sounds too good to be true, but if it actually works and saves me time, I'd become a power user immediately. Then you could charge me later when I'm hooked."* - Agency Owner
